# Description
The proposed project is to create an arcade machine using a Raspberry Pi with an emulator.

It's worth noting that the following process has been carried out on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and future models may have certain differences.

# Raspberry Preparation
## Requirements
To prepare the Raspberry Pi, we will need the following elements:

  -A USB drive with a micro SD slot or some way to connect the micro SD to the computer.  
  -An optional Ethernet cable for network connection.  
  -A Type-C charger necessary to power our Raspberry Pi.  
  -A micro HDMI to HDMI cable (or any cable that can connect to a monitor).  
  -A USB controller to navigate within the Raspberry Pi's graphical interface.  


## SD card preparation
First, we need to download an SD card reader program. In this case, we will use Raspberry Pi Imager.

(Insert images of the process)

You can find it at the following address:

Once the process is complete, we will reinsert the card into the Raspberry Pi slot.

## Environment Preparation

At this point, we have all the requirements, and our Raspberry Pi is connected and functional.

## Initial Configuration

The first thing we will be asked to do is determine the inputs for our controller. If our controller does not have all the buttons, we can always hold down a button to skip this input.
